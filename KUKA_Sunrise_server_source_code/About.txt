---------------
Kept record keeping and for old users.
Older packages the server application are provided in zip files:
1- KST_1.7: (code in this zip file are not updated anymore) same as KST_1.6 but hard-coding has been avoided in the source code,
            so same source code works for iiwa7R800 and iiwa14R820.
2- KST_1.6: Two source codes of the server application are provided one for the iiwa7R800 and the other is for the iiwa14R820.
3- KST_1.5: (Deprecated) does not support conditional and nonblocking motions.



Each zip file of the older KST packages is provided with two flavors:
	1- First flavor supports a touch-pneumatic flange. 
	2- Another flavor is universal works on the robot regardless of the type of the flange, since that flange associated functionalities are disabled.
