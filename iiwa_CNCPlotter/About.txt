ABOUT:
-------
"CNCPlotter" folder contains MATLAB script that allows the owner of
IIWA robot to use it as a Computer Numerically Controlled Plotter.

The MATLAB script (KSTclass_Tutorial_CNCPlotter)
is the main script that allows the owner of Kuka iiwa to use his
manipulator as a plotter/CNC-cutter.

In such a case the kuka iiwa plots/cuts drawings made by cad 
programs.

If you wish to use the script with different tool/robot configuraitons: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- By default the MATLAB script (KSTclass_Tutorial_CNCPlotter)
    is prepared to work with iiwa 7R800, using our plotting tool, 
    if you have different robot/tool please follow the instructions 
    in the file (KSTclass_Tutorial_CNCPlotter).


If you wish to use the script for plotting your own drawings: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default the MATLAB script (KSTclass_Tutorial_CNCPlotter)
is prepared to plot the file (kst.plt) if you want to plot a different file 
take the following into consideration

1- The cad file format supported is HP Graphic Language
   Plot file (plt). The user shall convert his drawing into
   (plt) file format, then using KST and the provided script 
   the user can execute the drawing on the robot.

2- Pefore executing your (plt) file on the robot, the user shall
   test it, by plotting it in matlab using the script file (plot_plt_in_graph).
   Follow the instructions in the script file (plot_plt_in_graph) to do this.

3- The user shall specify the path/name of the file to be plotted
   (plt file) in the variable (fileName).

4- By using the script file (plot_plt_in_graph), you can adjust the scale 
     and the position of your drawing visually before plotting it.

5- Copy the scale and the positioning parameters that you used in (plot_plt_in_graph),
    into the (KSTclass_Tutorial_CNCPlotter).
     

Enjoy....
