A Toolbox used to control KUKA iiwa 7 R 800 robot from an external computer using Matlab.

Using the KST the utilizer can control the iiwa robot from his/her computer without a need for programming  the industerial manipulator.

A basic knowledge of using Matlab is required.


--------------------------------------

# Video Tutorials on how to utilize the toolbox are available at:

* Video tutorials on KST version 1.7 are [available here]().
* Video tutorials on earlier versions of KST are [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yTK0Gi0p3g&list=PLz558OYgHuZdVzTaB79iM8Y8u6EjFe0d8)

The newer version of KUKS Sunrise Toolbox (KST-1.7) provides a wrapper class that wraps the various functions of earlier versions in the file KST.m. As such earlier versions of KST still works with the newer version 1.7. And the user has the freedom of choice to utilize KST-1.7 or eariler versions according to his own preference.

# Videos gallery:

Video demos where MATLAB and KST are used to control iiwa manipulator are [available here](https://github.com/Modi1987/KST-Kuka-Sunrise-Toolbox/wiki/Videos). 
The video examples range from pick and place applications where kinect camera is utilized for objects recognition and localization, to realtime collision avoidance with coworker/dynamic-obstacles in practical robotic cell, to controlling the manipulator from 3D simulation software or using external hardware and more.
